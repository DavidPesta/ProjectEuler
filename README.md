## ProjectEuler.net

Project Euler is a large collection of progressively challenging mathematical problems that are meant to be solved by writing code. As I work through them, I post my personal solutions to this repository on GitHub for the world to see.

At this time, it is against Project Euler's rules to publicly post solutions beyond problem #100. Therefore, in respect for their rules, this repository will be limited to problems 1 through 100.
